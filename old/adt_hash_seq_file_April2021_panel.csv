","Phosphatase, T and B cell activation","CD45R, also known as B220, is an isoform of CD45. It is a member of the protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) family with a molecular weight of approximately 180-240 kD. CD45R is expressed on B cells (at all developmental stages from pro-B cells through mature B cells), activated B cells, and subsets of T and NK cells. CD45R (B220) is also expressed on a subset of abnormal T cells involved in the pathogenesis of systemic autoimmunity in MRL-Faslpr and MRL-Fasgld mice. It plays a critical role in TCR and BCR signaling. The primary ligands for CD45 are galectin-1, CD2, CD3, and CD4. CD45R is commonly used as a pan-B cell marker; however, CD19 may be more appropriate for B cell specificity.

Although CD301a and CD301b share high amino acid sequence homology (92% for the intact sequence and 80% for the CRD), they display different carbohydrate specificities. CD301a was found to be highly specific for Lewis X and Lewis A structures, whereas CD301b, more similar to human MGL, recognizes N-actetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) and galactose, including the O-linked Tn-antigen, TF-antigen, and core 2.Â So far, CD301a has been reported to be involved in recognition andÂ endocytosis of glycoproteins with terminal Gal/GalNAc moieties.

This occurs early in development. Cells expressing CD43 include Î³/Î´ T cells, macrophages, mature B cells, and dendritic cells. CD43 functions as an anti-adhesive surface molecule, promoted by antibody cross-linking, that releases the trailing edge of the cell during locomotion to allow movement of the cell body towards the lamellipodia. The intracellular distribution of CD43 is determined by binding to moesin, an intracellular membrane protein, which is in-turn bound in some manner to the actin cytoskeleton. Defects with CD43 function and expression retard cellular locomotion, resulting in a wide range of immune disorders.

",Co-receptor for TCR,"CD8, also known as Lyt-2, Ly-2, or T8, consists of disulfide-linked Î± and Î² chains that form the Î±(CD8a)/Î²(CD8b) heterodimer and Î±/Î± homodimer. CD8a is a 34 kD protein that belongs to the immunoglobulin family. The CD8 Î±/Î² heterodimer is expressed on the surface of most thymocytes and a subset of mature TCR Î±/Î² T cells. CD8 expression on mature T cells is non-overlapping with CD4. The CD8 Î±/Î± homodimer is expressed on a subset of Î³/Î´ TCR-bearing T cells, NK cells, intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes, and lymphoid dendritic cells. CD8 is an antigen co-receptor on T cells that interacts with MHC class I on antigen-presenting cells or epithelial cells. CD8 promotes T cell activation through its association with the TCR complex and protein tyrosine kinase lck.

CD93 expression level on splenic immature/transitional B cells is much lower than in bone marrow. It is reinduced during plasma cell differentiation and plays an important role in maintaining plasma cells in bone marrow niches. Immature dendritic cells express CD93 and down-regulate this molecule upon maturation, suggesting a role in uptake of particles by DC. It is also expressed on monocytes, macrophages, and endothelial cells.

HT1,T,bad,,,,,"TotalSeqâ¢ anti-mouse Hashtag reagent is a mixture of two monoclonal antibodies conjugated to the same oligonucleotide. The antibodies are specific against mouse CD45 and MHC class I (of a, b,Â d, j, k, s, and u haplotypes) and can be used to label hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cells in most commonly used mouse strains for multiplex single cell sequencing analysis. The conjugated antibodies are pre-mixed to be used following an optimized protocol similar to the CITE-seq workflow. CD45 is a 180-240 kD glycoprotein also known as the leukocyte common antigen (LCA), T200, or Ly-5. It is a member of the protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) family, expressed on all hematopoietic cells except mature erythrocytes and platelets. CD45 plays a key role in TCR and BCR signal transduction. MHC class I is involved in antigen presentation to T cells expressing CD3/TCR and CD8 proteins. The M1/42 antibody reacts with the H-2 MHC class I alloantigens expressed on nucleated cells from mice of the a, b, d, j, k, s, and u haplotypes (Stallcup, KC et al, 1981). Importantly, some cell lines or experimental models may lack or express very low levels of either or both CD45 and MHC I molecules. We recommend a pilot experiment before single cell proteogenomics to confirm expression of these molecules in your experimental system. Different mouse strains express different MHC I haplotypes.

It is also found in brain, heart, kidney, liver, and other organs. ",,Play an important role in regulating lymphocyte activation and homeostasis in immune responses.,"Herpes Virus Entry Mediator (HVEM, TR2) is a type I transmembrane protein of TNF-receptor superfamily. This receptor was identified as a cellular mediator of herpes simplex virus (HAS) entry. Binding of HSV viral envelope glycoprotein D to this receptor has been shown to be part of the viral entry mechanism. It is expressed on most cell types, including T cells, B cells, monocytes, neutrophils, and dendritic cells. It is also found in brain, heart, kidney, liver, and other organs. The ligands of HVEM are LIGHT, BTLA, LTÎ±, and CD160. HVEM activates NF-kB through the TNF-related cytokine LIGHT to serve as a costimulatory pathway during T cell activation. HVEM also functions as a ligand for the Ig superfamily members B and T lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA) and CD160 to deliver a coinhibitory signal and limit inflammatory responses initiated by T cells. HVEM plays an important role in regulating lymphocyte activation and homeostasis in immune responses.

",,"Play an important role in CD4+ T cell responses, innate immunity to bacteria and parasites, and NK cell function.","Mouse Ly108, also known as SLAMF6 and NTB-A (NK cell, T cell, B cell antigen), is one of the members in The Signaling Lymphocytic Activation Molecule (SLAM) family of immune receptors. It is expressed on T cells, B cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, NK cells, and granulocytes. Homophilic interaction of Ly108 is involved in augmenting cytotoxicity of NK cells. Ly108 has been shown to function on NK cells by augmenting cytotoxicity. It was reported that Ly108 plays an important role in CD4+ T cell responses and innate immunity to bacteria and parasites. In a mouse with a targeted disruption of the Ly108 gene, CD4+ T cells and innate responses are defective. SLAM family of receptors has been implicated in the pathophysiology of autoimmunity. For instance, Ly108 is strongly linked to lupus susceptibility in mice. Ly108 may censor self-reactive B cells as a potential regulator of tolerance checkpoints, safeguarding against autoimmunity. Therefore, Ly108 serves as a regulator of both innate and adaptive immune responses.

CD169 binds to sialic acids, which can be found on PSGL-1, CD43, CD206, and CD227. By its affinity to Î±2, 3-linked sialic acid, it is involved in macrophage binding to different cell types such as granulocytes, monocytes, NK, B, and T cells. CD169 was initially identified as a sialic acid-dependent sheep erythrocyte receptor (SER) on resident bone marrow cells of mice. It has been identified as highly expressed on resident bone marrow macrophages which plays an important role in retention of stem cells in mesenchymal stem cell niche. It is also found on some specific subsets of tissue macrophages in spleen, lymph nodes, bone marrow, liver, colon, lungs, and cancer cells. Evidence suggest that CD169-positive macrophages serve as lymph node-resident APCs to dominate early activation of tumor antigen-specific CD8+ T cells and invariant NK cell.

",,Negative regulator of the immune response.,"PD-1H, also known as VISTA, is a 309 aa type I transmembrane protein that is composed of seven exons. PD-1H has one Ig-V like domain, and its sequence is similar to the Ig-V domains of the members of CD28 and B7 families. PD-1H is expressed by a subset of T cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, neutrophils, and natural killer cells (NK). It has been proposed that PD-1H can be useful to modulate the host immune response to allogeneic transplants due to its ability to preferentially suppress CD4+ T cell-mediated immunity.
