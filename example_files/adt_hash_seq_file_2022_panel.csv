Additional reported applications (for the relevant formats) include: immunoprecipitation1; in vitro and in vivo modulation of B cell responses2-4; and immunohistochemistry of acetone-fixed frozen sections and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections5;6.   ,Phosphatase; T and B cell activation,CD45R; also known as B220; is an isoform of CD45. It is a member of the protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) family with a molecular weight of approximately 180-240 kD. CD45R is expressed on B cells (at all developmental stages from pro-B cells through mature B cells); activated B cells; and subsets of T and NK cells. CD45R (B220) is also expressed on a subset of abnormal T cells involved in the pathogenesis of systemic autoimmunity in MRL-Faslpr and MRL-Fasgld mice. It plays a critical role in TCR and BCR signaling. The primary ligands for CD45 are galectin-1; CD2; CD3; and CD4. CD45R is commonly used as a pan-B cell marker; however; CD19 may be more appropriate for B cell specificity.  Product Details,19264;5788,Ptprc,Monoclonal,1. Barclay A; et al. 1997.

Clone 6A6 antibody reacts only with the C57BL/6 allele of BTLA but not the BALB/c allele of BTLA.   ,BTLA functions as a negative regulator of T cell activation and proliferation; attenuate B cell proliferation upon associating with its known ligand; herpes virus entry mediator (HVEM).,CD272; also known as B and T lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA); is an Ig superfamily co-inhitory receptor with structural similarity to programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) and CTLA-4.å BTLA is expressed on B cells; T cells; macrophages; dendritic cells; NKT cells; and NK cells. Engagement of BTLA by its ligand herpes virus entry mediator (HVEM) is critical for negatively regulating immune response.å The absence of BTLA with HVEM inhibitory interactions leads to increased experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis severity; enhanced rejection of partially mismatched allografts; an increased CD8+ memory T cell population; increased severity of colitis; and reduced effectiveness of T regulatory cells.å BTLA plays an important role in the induction of peripheral tolerance of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in vivo.å Tolerant T cells have significantly higher expression of BTLA compared with effectors and naÌøve T cells.å BTLA may cooperate with CTLA-4 and PD-1 to control T cell tolerance and autoimmunity.å It was reported that BTLA may regulate T cell function by binding to B7-H4; but further studies are needed to confirm.å The existence of three distinct BTLA alleles has been reported.

CCR4 binds CCL17 (TARG) and CCL22 (MDC). NaÌøve T cells; bearing receptors for cutaneous antigens; become activated in skin-draining lymph nodes and express cutaneous lymphocyte antigen (CLA); which confers to these cells the capacity to migrate into the skin to exert their normal effector functions (1). CCR4 and CCR10 play an important role in the ligand-mediated recruitment of T cells into the skin in mice and humans; specifically with regards to tethering; firm adhesion; and subsequent extravasation to the site of injury (2;3). CCR4 is expressed in cutaneous regulatory T cells (Tregs). These cells are crucial for the induction and maintenance of self-tolerance and are present in peripheral tissues such as skin and gut under normal; noninflamed conditions (4).In addition; recruitment of Foxp3+ T regulatory cells mediating allograft tolerance depends on the CCR4 chemokine receptor and its ligand CCL22 (5).

The S11 antibody reacts with pan-CD43.  ,Plays dual roles in cell-cell adhesion and anti-adhesion; costimulation of cell activation and survival; and induction of apoptosis of T cells and hematopoietic progenitors.,CD43; also known as Leukosialin and Ly48; is a 125 kD sialoprotein (glycosylated protein) expressed from 1.2 kBase mRNA in bone marrow-derived cells. This occurs early in development. Cells expressing CD43 include ë_/ë« T cells; macrophages; mature B cells; and dendritic cells. CD43 functions as an anti-adhesive surface molecule; promoted by antibody cross-linking; that releases the trailing edge of the cell during locomotion to allow movement of the cell body towards the lamellipodia. The intracellular distribution of CD43 is determined by binding to moesin; an intracellular membrane protein; which is in-turn bound in some manner to the actin cytoskeleton. Defects with CD43 function and expression retard cellular locomotion; resulting in a wide range of immune disorders. Wiscott-Alderich syndrome; and the varying degrees of its severity; is related to the dysregulation of CD43 expression.  Product Details,20737,Spn,Monoclonal,1. Van den Berg TK; et al. 2001. J.

Cross-reactivity to ferret has been reported by a collaborator; but not verified in house.   ,Leukocyte attachment and rolling on endothelial cells; stromal cells and ECM,CD44 is a 80-95 kD glycoprotein also known as Hermes; Pgp1; H-CAM; or HUTCH. It is expressed on all leukocytes; endothelial cells; hepatocytes; and mesenchymal cells. As B and T cells become activated or progress to the memory stage; CD44 expression increases from low or mid levels to high levels. Thus; CD44 has been reported to be a valuable marker for memory cell subsets. High CD44 expression on Treg cells has been associated with potent suppressive function via high production of IL-10. CD44 is an adhesion molecule involved in leukocyte attachment to and rolling on endothelial cells; homing to peripheral lymphoid organs and to the sites of inflammation; and leukocyte aggregation.

Cell surface CD178 is expressed on activated T cells and in testis and eye. CD178 is upregulated in activated T cells upon TCR re-engagement and has been shown to induce autocrine and paracrine T cell death. CD178 expression in the eye and testis has been shown to participate in immune privilege at these sites. CD178 can be cleaved from the surface by metalloproteases; and ""soluble"" CD178 may block the activities of membrane-bound CD178. CD178 binds to CD95 (Fas) to induce apoptotic cell death implicated in the maintenance of peripheral tolerance. CD178/CD95 interactions have also been implicated in the proliferation of CD8+ cells and neutrophil extravasation; chemotaxis; and survival. The MFL3 antibody recognizes CD178 in a wide array of mouse strains and has been reported to block CD178/CD95 induced apoptosis.  Product Details",14103,Fasl,Monoclonal,1. Barclay A; et al. 1997.

It associates with either the common ë_-chain (CD132) to form the type I IL-4R complex; which specifically binds IL-4; or with IL-13Ra1 to form the type II IL-4R heterodimeric complex; which binds and transduces signals from either IL-4 or IL-13.å A truncated form of IL-4Rë± exists in soluble form in biological fluids. CD124 is expressed on mouse late precursors and mature B cells; T cells; monocytes; and has low expression on granulocytes.å In B cells; CD124 can bind IL-4 and IL-13 and regulate IgE antibody production. In T cells; the type I IL-4R (IL-4R/gC) is mostly responsible for Th2 cell expansion by mediating IL-4-dependent activation of the transcription factors in hematopoietic cells. The type II IL-4R (IL-4R/IL-13Ra1) is the main route for nonhematopoietic cell responses to IL-4 or IL-13.  Product Details,16190,Il4ra,Monoclonal,1. Kashiwada M; et al. 2001. J.

It is expressed on T cells; B cells; macrophages; dendritic cells; NK cells; and granulocytes. Homophilic interaction of Ly108 is involved in augmenting cytotoxicity of NK cells. Ly108 has been shown to function on NK cells by augmenting cytotoxicity. It was reported that Ly108 plays an important role in CD4+ T cell responses and innate immunity to bacteria and parasites. In a mouse with a targeted disruption of the Ly108 gene; CD4+ T cells and innate responses are defective. SLAM family of receptors has been implicated in the pathophysiology of autoimmunity. For instance; Ly108 is strongly linked to lupus susceptibility in mice. Ly108 may censor self-reactive B cells as a potential regulator of tolerance checkpoints; safeguarding against autoimmunity. Therefore; Ly108 serves as a regulator of both innate and adaptive immune responses.  Product Details,30925,Slamf6,Monoclonal,1. Howie D; et al. 2005. J.

This ligand is a 42 kD member of the immunoglobulin receptor superfamily expressed on a subset of dendritic cells; liver and a small subset of macrophages as well as a few transformed cell lines. CD273 has been reported to be stimulatory on dendritic cells when cross-linked and to inhibit T cell activation upon engaging the PD-1 receptor. CD273 has also been reported to bind to an alternative receptor and to mediate T cell activation through such non-PD1 mediated interactions. The TY25 antibody has been reported to be useful for blocking PD-1 mediated interactions.  Product Details,58205,Pdcd1lg2,Monoclonal,1. Shin T; et al. 2003. J. Exp. Med. 198:31. 2.
